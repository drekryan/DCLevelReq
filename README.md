# DCLevelReq Quest Requirement [![Build Status](http://ci.drekryan.com/buildStatus/icon?job=DCLevelReq)](http://ci.drekryan.com/job/DCLevelReq/)

Author: [Drekryan](https://www.github.com/Drekryan)

This is a Custom Requirement Module for the [Quests](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/quests.3711/) 
plugin on Spigot using the Quests Custom Requirement API.

This module hooks into [DwarfCraft](https://www.github.com/Jessy1237) to check a players level in a
particular skill. If you meet the skill level set this requirement
will pass and you will be able to accept the Quest through the Quests
plugin, otherwise it will fail and force you to met the level requirement
before taking the Quest.

This module is public and you are free to use it as you wish or modify
it any way you like.
