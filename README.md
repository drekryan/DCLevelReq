# DCLevelReq Quest Requirement [![Build Status](http://ci.drekryan.com/buildStatus/icon?job=DCLevelReq)](http://ci.drekryan.com/job/DCLevelReq/)

Author: [Drekryan](https://www.github.com/Drekryan)

These are custom modules for the [Quests](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/quests.3711/) 
 and [BetonQuest](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/betonquest.2117/) plugins on Spigot.

This module hooks into [DwarfCraft](https://www.github.com/Jessy1237) to check a 
players level in a particular skill which is great for RPG-like servers.

These modules are public and you are free to use them as you wish or modify
them any way you like.
