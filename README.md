# DwarfCraft Quest Requirements

Author: [Drekryan](https://www.github.com/Drekryan)

These are custom requirements modules for the [Quests](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/quests.3711/) plugin on Spigot.

This module hooks into [DwarfCraft](https://www.github.com/Jessy1237) to check a players level in a 
particular DwarfCraft skill or a players race in DwarfCraft for Quests which is great for RPG-like servers.

These modules are public and you are free to use them as you wish or modify
them any way you like.
